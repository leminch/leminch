# About me ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Exeter, with links to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Singapore Botanic Gardens.
- ğŸŒ³ I study the evolution and breeding systems of tropical rainforest trees in Southeast Asia. 
- ğŸ§¬ I use DNA sequences to understand what has happened both in the deep evolutionary past of these trees, and also recent hybridisation events in present-day tree communities.
- ğŸ’» I code mainly in bash but I'm trying to learn R and python over the course of my PhD!
